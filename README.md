# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description
## Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
I built this project because it enabled me to use my knowledge of javascript and assess my ablity to use data which can be in several forms within javascript.
## What problem does it solve?
This would be able to solve the possible real life problem of extracting data for use within a company, gathering the data for year and then working out taxes.
## What did you learn?
I learnt that there are methods for arrays and nested arrays that you can use to manipulate the data from, I also made use of loops to go through the arrays to find the biggest match in highest number and date.
## What makes the project stand out?
My project stands out because of my utilization of comments to keep track of what is happening in the code whilst also in parts using the acceptance criteria as a checklist to tick off what I have done.
